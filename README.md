# Hyperglass Helm Charts
[![Latest stable release of the Helm chart](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/yaml.svg?label=stable&url=https://mowoe.github.io/hyperglass-helm/index.yaml&query=$.entries.hyperglass[0].version&color=1b53c2&logo=helm)](https://mowoe.github.io/hyperglass-helm)

## Overview

This repository contains helmcharts for a [hyperglass](https://hyperglass.dev/) deployment. The deployment includes a redis caching instance as well as a configurable [`hyperglass.yaml`](https://hyperglass.dev/docs/parameters) configuration file which is stored as a kubernetes ConfigMap and is later mounted as a file into the containers.
## Prerequisites
Consult the [official documentation]() on how to setup hyperglass, especially in regards to creating a `devices.yaml` config. Once you have created this config, you are ready to deploy hyperglass using this helmchart.

### Deployment via `helm` and `kubectl`
Hyperglass is mainly configured through two files: `hyperglass.yaml` and `devices.yaml`.

`hyperglass.yaml` is abstracted through the helm chart and its values can be configured via the `--set primary_asn=123456` flag, or by passing a `values.yaml` to `helm install`: `-f values.yaml`.

As the `devices.yaml` file differs greatly from deployment to deployment, the user is expected to pass a valid yaml object in `values.devices_config`. The easiest way to configure both `devices.yaml` and `hyperglass.yaml` is by modifying the `values.yaml` file stored in this repo.

#### Installation

Download the default `values.yaml` file for this chart:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mowoe/hyperglass-helm/main/charts/hyperglass/values.yaml
```
* Modify values.yaml with an editor of your choice

Add the helm repo:
```bash
helm repo add mowoe-hyperglass https://mowoe.github.io/hyperglass-helm
```
And install the chart with the modified `values.yaml`:
```bash
helm install -f values.yaml --create-namespace -n hyperglass mylookingglass mowoe-hyperglass/hyperglass
```
(Omit the `--create-namespace -n hyperglass` flags if youre on RedHat Openshift)

### Network configuration
Note that the default deployment will only use a `NodePort`-Service because the intended way to deploy this, is to have a seperate loadbalancer like traefik in place. If you want to directly assign a loadbalancer to the service you can change this to `LoadBalancer`.

#### Additional Information
Due to some unfourtunate design choices in hyperglass itself, the pods take quite some time (~1 min) to be ready, as they will always build the ui again upon start. After the first deployment, this shouldnt be an issue though, as the service will only hand off traffic to new replica sets as soon as the pods are fully ready (like you would expect).
